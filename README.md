Branding for the LEG architecture

After the holdings company of _an architecture which shall not be named_ took [legal action against an independent author](https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/31/a_star_star_domains/), we present an alternate brand to discuss _the architecture which shall not be named_.

By all accounts, the concept for the LEG architecture is the brainchild of @azeria-labs. The artwork contained in this repository is CC-BY-ND. You're free to make stickers of it so long as you don't remove the "@indrora made this" hint. You are free however to use the "LEG" with underbar.

The fonts I used are Helsinki and BR-OCRB, which are (unforuntately) owned by Brother. They are otherwise "A slab Sans and an OCR-B compatible font". I'm sure you can find something. I may make an Alternate version which uses more easily available typefaces.
